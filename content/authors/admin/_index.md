I am currently working on the future of electric mobility at BorgWarner. Designing Hardware and algorithmic solutions for efficient and safe control of electric motors in vehicles.

__Outside of work__: Have been exploring Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques due to my longstanding interest in Robotics and other intelligent systems. I believe that efficient algorithms with **generalization** accross multiple tasks and **incremental/continual learning** ability are necessary for achieving **truly intelligent systems**.

Glad to see recent progress in Massively parallel GPU accelerated simulators/environments (Brax, Nvidia Isaac gym, Habitat sim...) that brought down the time needed for training from days to hours on an average gaming PC. My (and for many) the biggest limitation is time and computing resources to try anything major. I am on the verge of developing a secondary interest in creating faster simultations and training pipeline, but again too short on time to be anymore adventurous :disappointed:

Contact me if you are interested in working with me or would like me to be in your team :point_left:
